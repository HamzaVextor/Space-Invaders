# Space Invaders Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Space Invaders game using the Python library, Pygame. 
The game features two spaceships, both of the spaceships are controlled by two players (yellow spaceship) and the other (red spaceship) 
as the enemy. The objective is to shoot down the enemy spaceship while avoiding its bullets and staying alive.

Bullets are limited for each spaceship (maximum of 2000 bullets).
The game declares the winner when one of the spaceships runs out of health or reaches the bullet limit.
